Repository of data and code to accompany Nature 2020-03-03523A (in review) Evershed R. et al 2021 Dairying, diseases and the evolution of  lactase persistence in Europe.

### Archaeological milk residue data
The folder *sherd residues* contains the table *milk residue summary.csv* which comprises 782 rows and 11 columns, providing a summary of archaeological attributes associated with 782 site-phases. This is the aggregation of previously published and new data, and provides site-specific data including the site name, country, latitude and longitude, as well as phase-specific data such as the cultural assignment, start and end dates, and the count of sherds that have been attributed as containing dairy or non-dairy residues from an animal origin, based on the analysis of their radiocarbon-13 profiles.

### Model timeseries variables
The folder *model timeseries variables* contains five .csv files, each comprising timeseries data for our three study regions, 'British Isles', 'North & Central Europe' and 'Mediterranean Europe', with the exception of 'midday insolation.csv' which varies between region but is assumed constant through time.
