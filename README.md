## Dairying, diseases and the evolution of  lactase persistence in Europe
This repository contains the data and code to accompany Nature 2020-03-03523A (in review) Evershed R. et al 2021 Dairying, diseases and the evolution of  lactase persistence in Europe.

### Archaeological milk residue data
The folder *sherd residues* contains the table *lipid residue summary.csv* which comprises 313 rows and 8 columns, providing a summary of novel previously unpublished archaeological attributes. This provides site-specific data including the site name, country, latitude and longitude, as well as phase-specific data such as the cultural assignment, start and end dates, and the count of sherds that have been attributed as containing dairy or non-dairy lipid residues from an animal origin, based on the analysis of their radiocarbon profiles giving a Δ13C values above or below the -3.1‰ dairy threshold.

### Model timeseries variables
The folder *model timeseries variables* contains five .csv files, each comprising timeseries data for four study regions, 'British Isles', 'Baltic region', 'Rhine Danube axis' and 'Mediterranean Europe'. Note, 'midday insolation.csv' varies between region but is assumed constant through time.

### Radiocarbon dates
The folder *radiocarbon dates* contains four .csv files, each containing a summary of the number of radiocarbon dates and their locations, for each of the four study regions, 'British Isles', 'Baltic region', 'Rhine Danube axis' and 'Mediterranean Europe'.

### KML
The folder *KML* contains seven .kml files providing the data locations. LP sites.kml and nonLP sites.kml specify the locations of aDNA and can be viewed in conunction withpolygons.model.6.kml to see how the aDNA data were separated into useful polygons. The file sites.sherds.kml specifies the locations of all pot sherd data, and can be viewed in conjunction with polygons.milk.11.kml to see how these data were geographically separated into polygons. Good spatial overlap between data types (aDNA, faunal, radiocarbon, milk sherds) was only achieved for four of the polyons in polygons.model.6.kml: 'British Isles', 'Baltic region', 'Rhine Danube axis' and 'Mediterranean Europe'.
