## Dairying, diseases and the evolution of  lactase persistence in Europe
This repository contains the data and code to accompany Nature 2020-03-03523A (in review) Evershed R. et al 2021 Dairying, diseases and the evolution of  lactase persistence in Europe.

### Archaeological milk residue data
The folder *sherd residues* contains the table *lipid residue summary.csv* which comprises 313 rows and 8 columns, providing a summary of novel previously unpublished archaeological attributes. This provides site-specific data including the site name, country, latitude and longitude, as well as phase-specific data such as the cultural assignment, start and end dates, and the count of sherds that have been attributed as containing dairy or non-dairy lipid residues from an animal origin, based on the analysis of their radiocarbon profiles giving a Δ13C values above or below the -3.1‰ dairy threshold.

### Model timeseries variables
The folder *model timeseries variables* contains five .csv files, each comprising timeseries data for our three study regions, 'British Isles', 'North & Central Europe' and 'Mediterranean Europe', with the exception of 'midday insolation.csv' which varies between region but is assumed constant through time.
